        <source>SMS messages containing marketing messages should be marked as "Promotional". Amazon SNS ensures that such messages are sent over routes that have reasonable transmission reliability, but are significantly less expensive than the most reliable routes. This allows Amazon SNS to handle your messages in accordance with local laws and regulations.</source>

        <source>This ensures that messages, for example those containing one-time passwords (OTPs) or PINs, are sent via routes with the greatest dispatch reliability. Outside the U.S., these routes are typically more expensive than sending routes for commercial messages. You should never mark marketing messages as "Business," as this violates regulatory guidelines in certain countries and can get your account flagged as abusive and suspended.</source>
